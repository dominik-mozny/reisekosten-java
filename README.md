# Reisekosten - Travel expenses

## Data entry

As an employee I must record duration of my business travel,
so that I get my travel expenses reimbursed.

* Data to be recorded: start, end, destination, travel reason
* Travel end date must occur after travel start date
* Accounting accepts only one simultaneous travel

## Past travels

Travels can only be entered until January 10th of the following year,
so that accounting can close financial year reporting.
