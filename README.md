# Reisekosten - Travel expenses

## Data entry

As an employee I must record duration of my business travel,
so that I get my travel expenses reimbursed.

* Data to be recorded: start, end, destination, travel reason
* Travel end date must occur after travel start date
* Accounting accepts only one simultaneous travel

## Past travels

Travels can only be entered until January 10th of the following year,
so that accounting can close financial year reporting.

## Allowance

As an accountant I want the system to calculate travel allowance
in the end of the month, so that employees get their travel expenses
reimbursed.

* For each day of travel traveler receives 6 € starting from 
  8 hours of travel, 12 € from 12 hours and 24 € from 24 hours.
* Account receives tabular report containing:
  * Travels (start, destination, reason) with calculated allowance
  * Total allowance sum

## Special accounting for travels outside of EU

Allowance for travels outside of EU is 100 € per day
