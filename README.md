# Reisekosten - Travel expenses

## Data entry

As an employee I must record duration of my business travel,
so that I get my travel expenses reimbursed.

* Data to be recorded: start, end, destination, travel reason
* Travel end date must occur after travel start date
* Bookkeeping accepts only one simultaneous travel
